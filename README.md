# XSH - A Bash Static Site Generator

### How?
When running `make`, the "framework" will parse the content directory and build html files from the markdown contained within. Conventionally, the 
`content` directory should follow the below structure.

[!WARNING]
If you do not follow the directory structure shown below, your site will not be built correctly

### Why?
This project is a wholly unnecessary endeavour. That being said; it serves as a useful reminder that we have a tendency to 
add complexity to our systems unnecessarily.
